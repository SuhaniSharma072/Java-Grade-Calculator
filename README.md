My Java Grade Calculator takes major/minor grade and the weight for each as user input. I made this project because I personally use a website to calculate my grades at school. I thought that I could use my existing knowledge of user input from AP Computer Science Principles to build that. The part I struggled with was adding the if conditionals because we hadn't learned that at school yet so I had to learn myself in order to output the letter grade.
